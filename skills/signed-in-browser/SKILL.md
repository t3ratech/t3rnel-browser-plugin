description: Drive the browser the user is already signed into, instead of a cold automation profile. Use when a task lives behind a login — a dashboard, an admin console, an internal tool, a ticket queue, a bank or billing page, webmail, a social account — or when a scripted login is failing on SSO, MFA, CAPTCHA or bot detection. Also use for reading a page's real rendered CSS, capturing a full page, inspecting React state, or recording and replaying a UI flow against a live session.

# Working in a browser the user is already signed into

Most browser automation starts from an empty profile: no cookies, no session, no access
to anything behind a login. For public pages that is fine and you should keep using it.

This skill is for the other case — where the *authentication is the hard part*. A
scripted login against SSO, MFA, a CAPTCHA or bot detection is slow to build, brittle to
keep, and often against the site's terms. Attaching to a session the user already has
skips all of it.

The tools come from the **T3rnel Session Bridge** MCP server (`session_*`). It is a local
stdio server; nothing is hosted and no page content leaves the machine.

## Decide first: does this task actually need a real session?

| Situation | What to use |
|---|---|
| Public page, no login | An ordinary headless browser or `fetch`. Don't reach for this. |
| Anything behind a login | This skill. |
| A scripted login that keeps breaking | This skill — stop maintaining the login. |
| Reading a page's *rendered* CSS, or its React tree | This skill; static HTML won't have it. |
| Bulk scraping of a site you have no account on | Neither. That's a different problem. |

If the page is public, say so and use the simpler tool. Reaching into someone's live
browser for a page you could have fetched is a cost with no benefit.

## The rule that matters most

**This is the user's real browser, logged into their real accounts.** A wrong click here
is not a failed test — it can send an email, cancel a subscription, post publicly, or
move money.

1. **Read before you write.** `session_list_tabs`, then `session_snapshot` or
   `session_read_page`, before any click or fill.
2. **Confirm anything irreversible**, in your own words, before doing it: purchases,
   payments, sending or publishing, deleting, permission and sharing changes, anything
   in an account-settings or billing page. Describe the specific action and wait.
3. **Never enter credentials you generated.** If a field is a password, an OTP, a card
   number or a security answer, stop and ask. `session_store_login` exists so the user
   supplies these once, deliberately.
4. **Stay on the tab you were given.** Don't wander into other tabs of a signed-in
   browser looking for context.

## Workflow

```
session_list_tabs          → find the tab, or confirm which one the user means
session_navigate           → go somewhere (reuses the active tab unless newTab: true)
session_snapshot           → see the accessibility tree: what is actually clickable
session_click / _fill      → act, using a selector you saw in the snapshot
session_snapshot again     → verify the outcome changed the way you expected
```

**Verify, don't assume.** A click that resolves is not a click that worked. Re-snapshot
and assert the thing you expected: the row is gone, the banner says saved, the URL moved.
Half of all silent automation failures are a selector that matched nothing and a caller
that never looked.

Prefer selectors you have just seen in a snapshot over ones you guessed from memory of
how the site used to look.

## When something isn't there

- **No browser session / relay not found.** The bridge falls back to a standalone
  automation browser, which works but is signed into nothing. If the task needs the
  user's session, call **`session_install`** — it returns the current instructions for
  adding the free T3rnel Browser extension, which is what supplies the signed-in half.
- **A tool says it needs a licence.** The bridge itself is free and holds no licence.
  Some of the deeper extension tools (CSS-as-component export, the React inspector,
  session recording, the credential vault) are part of the extension's paid tier; the
  refusal comes from the extension and names what it needs. Report it and move on; don't
  retry it in a loop.
- **A page won't load or a selector never appears.** Use `session_wait` on a condition
  rather than sleeping, then re-snapshot. If it still isn't there, say so — do not
  invent a selector.

## What the extension adds

The bridge on its own serves 20 tools against a standalone browser. With the free
T3rnel Browser extension connected, the same server serves 99 — the extra ones run
inside the user's real tabs:

- **CSS extraction** — copy an element's *computed* styles out as a component
  (styled-components, Tailwind, CSS Modules, JSX and others), which static HTML cannot
  give you.
- **Full-page capture** and annotation, beyond the viewport.
- **React inspector** — component tree, props and state on a running app.
- **Network and console capture** for what the page actually did.
- **Form filling** that respects each field's real constraints, and never invents
  passwords, OTPs or card numbers.
- **Record and replay** a UI flow, and export it as a Playwright, Puppeteer, Cypress or
  Selenium spec.

`session_install` explains how to add it. The extension is free; the tools listed above
that are marked Pro will say so themselves when called.

## Setup

```bash
npx -y @t3ratech/mcp-session-bridge
```

Or add it to any MCP client's config as a stdio server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "t3rnel-session": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@t3ratech/mcp-session-bridge"]
    }
  }
}
```

Optional environment: `T3RNEL_SESSION_MODE` (`auto` | `extension` | `standalone`),
`T3RNEL_SESSION_HEADLESS=1`, `T3RNEL_SESSION_TIMEOUT_MS`.
